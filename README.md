# Organ-Checklist

This program is intended to act as an interactive command-line checklist for the gross anatomy (limited to the chest cavity).
It was built using Python 3.4.

To run the program:
`python hierarchysearch.py`


Tests
------

The composed tests examine the deselect, select, and is_part() functions of the BodyPart class using the wrapper class, Body. Furthermore, these tests are limited in that they examine if the inner recursive functions work simply by examining the output.

To run the tests:
`python hierarchytest.py`
